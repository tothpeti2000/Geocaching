# Geocaching

The app contains the main script, _**geocaching.sh**_ and an Express server to test the script.

## How to test the script?

- Start the server: `node index.js`

- Remove the files generated by an earlier script execution, then run the script: `rm files/* && ./geocaching.sh http://localhost:3000`
